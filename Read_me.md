This is a Discount Calculator application that prompts the user to enter two inputs to determine if the customer gets a discount or not. The price of an item bought is entered together with the discount percentage. 

The Discount Calculator checks if the discount percentage is greater or equal to 20% or not by using if...else statement. If the condition is true, the discount amount is calculated from the original price by the entered percentage rate and then the final price will be calculated. Then the output will be printed showing that the discount has been allowed and the final price will also be displayed. 

Else if the condition is false, meaning the discount percentage is less than 20%, else statement will be executed and the original price will remain as it is. The output printed will show that "No discount allowed." And that, the price remains as the original price. 

To ensure that the user does not enter non-numeric values, a try...except event handler has been used to catch any error done by the user. If it happens that the user enters anything other than the value. An error message will be printed to show that the user should only enter numeric values.
